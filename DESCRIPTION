Description: In data analysis we sometimes need to correctly identify clusters from a heterogeneous
             population, which is the problem named subgroup analysis. A popular method for analyzing data
             from a heterogeneous population is to view data as coming from a mixture of subgroups with
             their own sets of parameter values and then apply finite mixture model analysis. In this
             package, two approaches are implemented in three functions. The mixture model approach are
             implemented in a R function and a Rcpp function, and the concave pairwise fushion approach
             are implemented in a R function. A detailed description and comparison of the two approaches
             are also given in a vignette.
